# Copyright Helper

Sometimes you need to add a copyright notice to every single page of a project, and you also want to bundle all of those files into a single text document. This will help you do that.

### Usage

Open up `index.js`, and set the root directory and joinedFilePath, the file that should have the combined output. 

In the root directory, add a file called `.copyright` with the text you'd like to include.

Run `npm run start`
